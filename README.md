# Home Lab Infrastructure

## Overview
This repository documents the setup of my personal home lab. I repurposed an older PC to create a server environment managed by **Coolify**. The goal was to easily deploy and manage a Minecraft server without needing to manually configure complex container settings.

## Hardware Specifications
* **CPU:** Intel Core i5 (2nd Gen)
* **RAM:** 8GB
* **Storage:** 1TB HDD
* **OS:** Linux Mint
* **Form Factor:** Desktop PC

## Software Stack
* **Management Platform:** Coolify (Self-hosted)
* **Underlying Engine:** Docker (Managed automatically by Coolify)
* **OS:** Linux Mint

## Services Hosted
1.  **Minecraft Server:** Deployed via Coolify's "One-Click" service, allowing for easy management of the game server.
2.  **Server Management:** Using Coolify's dashboard to monitor the server status and resources.

## Key Learnings
* **Automated Deployment:** Learned how to use tools like Coolify to simplify the deployment of services.
* **Linux Environment:** Experience installing and navigating Linux Mint on legacy hardware.
* **Resource Management:** Monitoring how an i5 (2nd Gen) handles server loads using system tools.

## Future Improvements
* Learn the basics of manual Docker configuration.
* Set up remote access via SSH.
* Explore hosting a simple website.
